## Overview

**ResumeAnalyser** is an automated resume ranking and analysis application designed for recruiters and hiring managers. This tool accepts a ZIP file containing multiple PDF resumes and an optional job description text file. It then processes the resumes using advanced NLP techniques and scoring algorithms to rank candidates based on:

- **Technical & Managerial Skills:** Evaluated using years of experience, education level, and keyword-based skills extraction.
- **Resume Quality:** Assessed via spell-check ratios, section identification, and overall brevity.
- **Job Matching:** Uses TF-IDF similarity measures to compare resumes against the provided job description.

The final output is a ranked list of resumes with scores and downloadable results for further review.

---

## Features

- **Interactive UI with Streamlit:** Upload resumes and job descriptions, view processing status, and download results.
- **PDF Text Extraction:** Converts resumes in PDF format into text using libraries like PyPDF2 and pymupdf.
- **NLP-Powered Analysis:** 
  - **Preprocessing:** Tokenization and lemmatization using spaCy.
  - **Skill Extraction:** Identifies both general and technical skills.
  - **Experience & Education:** Extracts years of experience and detects education level.
  - **Resume Quality Metrics:** Spell-check, section identification, and brevity evaluation.
- **Scoring and Ranking:** Combines technical, managerial, and overall quality scores with job match scores (via TF-IDF similarity) to generate final rankings.
- **Downloadable Results:** 
  - CSV file containing all calculated scores.
  - Top 3 ranked resumes available as downloadable PDFs with an embedded viewer.
- **Default Job Skills Management:** Automatically loads or creates a default job skills file (`job_skills.json`) for reference during analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.7 or higher
- **Package Manager:** Pip
- **Required Libraries:** Streamlit, pandas, scikit-learn, spaCy, pymupdf, PyPDF2, language_tool_python, textblob, and others listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

       git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Resume_Analyser_for_Job_Description-2024-2025-Project.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   
       cd Team 1
       cd Resume_Analyser_for_Job_Description-2024-2025-Project
       

4. **Install Dependencies:**

       pip install -r requirements.txt
       python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

### Usage

To launch the Resume Ranking Application, use the following command:

    streamlit run app.py

This will start a local Streamlit server where you can:
- Upload a ZIP file containing PDF resumes.
- Optionally upload a job description (TXT file).
- View the analysis results, download the final ranked CSV, and retrieve the top ranked resume PDFs.
